            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome! My name is Kojo Otchere. As a passionate and driven Systems Engineer, I've cultivated a robust
                background in diverse industry sectors, including logistics & supply chain, enterprise support &
                development, and inside sales & business development. Currently, I'm leveraging my technical expertise
                and problem-solving skills at General Dynamics Information Technology, providing comprehensive
                engineering support for various subcontracting, sourcing, procurement, and supply chain activities. I
                take pride in being a vital technical contact and liaison, where I have successfully built strategic
                relationships with suppliers and established performance metrics to optimize processes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prior to my current role, I worked as a Support Engineer at MicroStrategy, Inc., and as a System Analyst
                at Akira Technologies, Inc. These roles allowed me to provide strategic engineering guidance for new
                software implementation, optimize SQL scripts, and establish relationships with high-priority clients,
                along with honing my skills in proposal development, solution implementation, and team coordination. I
                hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Systems Engineering from The George Washington University, and I've
                achieved various certifications, including the AWS Technical Professional and MicroStrategy Analyst
                Master Bootcamp. If you're seeking a collaborative and technically skilled Systems Engineer, I'd be
                delighted to connect.
