            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> My name is Kojo Otchere and I am an enthusiastic and result-driven Systems Engineer with a rich
                experience in various industry sectors including logistics & supply chain, enterprise support &
                development, and inside sales & business development. My technical expertise, problem-solving acumen,
                and strong work ethic make me a valuable asset to any team.

                Currently, I serve as a Systems Engineer at General Dynamics Information Technology, where I am
                responsible for providing comprehensive engineering support to various subcontract, sourcing,
                procurement, and supply chain activities. Here, I have had the opportunity to act as a crucial technical
                contact and a liaison, creating strategic relationships with suppliers and establishing performance
                metrics to streamline processes.

                Before this, I was with MicroStrategy, Inc as a Support Engineer. During my tenure, I provided strategic
                engineering guidance for the implementation and rollout of new software, optimized SQL scripts, built
                strong relationships with high-priority clients, and monitored health, performance, and operational
                trends to proactively identify and solve issues. Earlier in my career, I was a System Analyst at Akira
                Technologies, Inc., where I honed my skills in
                proposal development, solution implementation, and team coordination.</p>


            <p>I hold a Bachelor of Science in Systems Engineering from The George
                Washington University. To further enhance my skills, I have earned a variety of certifications including
                the AWS Technical Professional and MicroStrategy Analyst Master Bootcamp.</p>
